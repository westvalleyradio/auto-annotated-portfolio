title: Oh Wow Another Radio Station
date: '2025-06-01'
excerpt: >-
  Howdy, some of you reading this might know me personally (or not), and might
  be wondering, “Uhhh, what is this, your attempt at being a DJ, you cornball?”
  Reasonable thought to have, but no, actually, kinda. I decided to start West
  Valley Radio because I tune in to the radio from time to time in my car (when
  my phone’s dead, of course), and boy, am I disappointed every time. Not just
  because I heard Dua Lipa on two different stations at the same time, but
  because radio just isn’t what it used to be.Growing up, I listened to the
  radio all the time—on the way to school, during road trips with my family,
  even on a shitty little mp3 player. It wasn’t the only source of music
  discovery, but a huge one at that.Now you also might be wondering: why start a
  radio station? It’s a dying medium. You’re not wrong for thinking that, my
  dear reader — actually, radio is evolving more than anything. It’s become more
  accessible than ever, especially with 73% of the U.S. tuning in over the
  interwebs.Believe me, if I could broadcast on the airwaves, I would — but in
  1996, the government passed the Telecommunications Act, which allowed
  corporations like iHeartRadio to swallow up hundreds of stations, making it
  close to impossible for the community to get on the airwaves.With that being
  said, my vision for West Valley Radio is bigger than just an online radio
  station. I envision a platform where Arizona artists and bands can be
  showcased and get the attention FM radio stations don’t give them. A hub for
  all things surrounding music. All without being tied down to a single genre.
  This includes interviews, visual media, live sessions, and blogs like the one
  you’re reading now, you cutie.
