title: Oh Wow Another Radio Station
date: '2025-06-01'
excerpt: >-
  Howdy, some of you reading this might know me personally (or not), and might
  be wondering, "Uhhh what the hell you doin boy whatcha think you Tino
  Cochino?" Fair but no. I decided to start West Valley Radio because in the I
  listen to the radio from time to time in my car (when my phone's dead) and boy
  was I dissapointed. Not just because I heard Dua Lipa on two different
  stations at the same time, but because radio just isn't what it used to be.
  Growing up, I listened to the radio all the time, on the way to school, road
  trips with my family, even on a shitty little mp3 player because it took me
  forever to figure out limewire. Anyways
