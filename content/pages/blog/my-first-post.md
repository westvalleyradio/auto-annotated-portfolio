title: Oh Wow Another Radio Station
date: '2025-06-01'
excerpt: >-
  Howdy, some of you reading this might know me personally (or not), and might
  be wondering, "Uhhh what is this your attempt at being a DJ you cornball"
  Reasonable thought to have but no, actually, kinda. I decided to start West
  Valley Radio because I tune in to the radio from time to time in my car (when
  my phone's dead of course) and boy am I disappointed every time. Not just
  because I heard Dua Lipa on two different stations at the same time, but
  because radio just isn't what it used to be. Growing up, I listened to the
  radio all the time, on the way to school, road trips with my family, even on a
  shitty little mp3 player. It wasn't the only source of discovering music, but
  a huge one at that. Now you also might be wondering, why start a radio station
  it's a dying medium? you're not wrong for thinking that my dear reader,
  actually radio is evolving more than anything. It's become more accessable
  than ever. Online With that being said, my vision for West Valley Radio is
  bigger than just an radio station
